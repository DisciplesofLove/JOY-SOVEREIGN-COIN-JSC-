# Staking and Participation

JOY implements Proof of Stake (PoS) and Proof of Use (PoU) to secure governance.

## Proof of Stake
- Users lock JOY to become validators.
- Staking thresholds and rewards are enforced by the daemon.
- Misbehaving validators can be slashed.

## Proof of Use
- Activity such as inference routing and domain hosting earns participation points.
- Points multiply governance voting power and unlock rewards.

## Voting Power
Voting weight is derived from staked coins with a bonus based on the participation score. This encourages long-term holding and active use of JOY services.
